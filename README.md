# NotebookVault

This project was developed during Object Oriented Programming 1 course using Java language implementing basic OOP concepts. I have used IntelliJ Idea IDE for developing the project.

This is system where a user can write daily notes, can search a note by the title of the note, can set passcodes to the sensitive contents, can modify any notes and also can delete any note. 

There will be backup of the notes in the synced credential, from where the user can check out the notes anytime from anywhere.
